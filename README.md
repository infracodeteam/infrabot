## Running locally

### 1. Setup environment variables

SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=<your-signing-secret>
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=<your-bot-token>
SLACK_LOG_LEVEL=debug
SLACK_REQUEST_LOG_ENABLED=2
PORT=3000
```

### 2. Setup your local project

```zsh
# Install the dependencies
npm i

# To run debug
npm run debug 
# To run production
npm start
```

### 3. Start servers

* [Download ngrok][3]
* open it and run `ngrok http 3000` to create a local requests URL for development.
* copy the https address (ex: https://4219dee485a5.ngrok.io)
* go to the Event Subscriptions page and enter in the address under "Request URL"
  * include /slack/events endpoint ex: https://4219dee485a5.ngrok.io/slack/events
  * make sure you check the server often as it will automatically stop after about an hour
